# Snack-Game
In the game of Snake, the player uses the arrow keys to move a "snake" around the board. As the snake finds food, it eats the food, and thereby grows larger. The game ends when the snake either moves off the screen or moves into itself. The goal is to make the snake as large as possible before that happens.



Snake game is one of the most popular arcade games of all time. In this game, the main objective of the player is to catch the maximum number of fruits without hitting the wall or itself. Creating a snake game can be taken as a challenge while learning Python or Pygame. It is one of the best beginner-friendly projects that every novice programmer should take as a challenge. Learning to build a video game is kinda interesting and fun learning. 

We will be using Pygame to create this snake game. Pygame is an open-source library that is designed for making video games. It has inbuilt graphics and sound libraries. It is also beginner-friendly, and cross-platform.



Installation:
To install Pygame, you need to open up your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:


pip install pygame

Step 1: First we are importing the necessary libraries.
Step 2: After importing libraries we need to initialize Pygame using pygame.init() method. 
Step 3: Initialize snake position and its size.
Step 4: Create a function to display the score of the player.
